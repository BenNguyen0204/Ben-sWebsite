        <h2>Hi, my name is Ben. I'm an international Software Systems student at Simon Fraser University, originally
            from
            Vietnam.
            Although I haven't yet gained work experience in the software field, I've developed teamwork skills through
            school projects and my past part-time jobs.
            In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, working on coding projects, and exploring new technologies.
        </h2>
